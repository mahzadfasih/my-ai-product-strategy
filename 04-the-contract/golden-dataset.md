# Golden Dataset & Reliability Contract

## Golden Dataset

Test cases:
  1. Edge: N · Judge: both, IN: .xls of requirements → OUT: set of rules that map to requirements
  2. Edge: N · Judge: rule, IN: project data → OUT: measurement against rules
  3. Edge: Y · Judge: rule, IN: .pdf of requirements → OUT: set of rules that map to the requirements

Dataset health
- Total: 3
- Edge cases: 1 (33.3%)
- Judge mix: 67% rule / 0% LLM / 33% both

## Golden Dataset Spec

| # | Input | Expected Output | Edge Case? | Judge Type |
|---|-------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | | | Y/N | rule / LLM |
| 2 | | | Y/N | rule / LLM |
| 3 | | | Y/N | rule / LLM |
| 4 | | | Y/N | rule / LLM |
| 5 | | | Y/N | rule / LLM |

## Confidence UX Design

**Approach:** show uncertainty / tiered confidence / human-in-loop trigger

**High confidence (>90%):**
**Medium confidence (70-90%):**
**Low confidence (<70%):**

## Reliability Contract

| Metric | Target | Measurement | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy | | | |
| Hallucination rate | | | |
| Latency (p95) | | | |
| Drift velocity | | | |
